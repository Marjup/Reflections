Marju's Version Control Lesson 2 Reflections

1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository Git makes you a special hidden directory called .git that
contains the metadata (commit history) of the repository. The metadata enables you to get
back previous versions of the repository.


2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
   What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is not a physical directory on your computer, it is more like an abstraction of
directory. It makes possible to choose files you want to commit together also it is possible
to take back files, if you change your mind and don't want to commit files.
