Marju's Version Control Lesson 3 Reflections

1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   
   When you are working on multiple computers, it is safer to hold copy of a project always
   somewhere else than in your computer, that way you can be sure, that when something happens
   with your computer, you can get the data back.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
   stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
   
   Because you should always push to remote code that does work. Sometimes you make commits
   and you don't have a working feature yet, so you can keep working and commiting changes and
   finally when it works then you can push the changes to remote.
   
3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

   Forks can be used to clone someone else's repository on Github to your Github account and then you can
   clone the repository to your local machine. Then you can make a new branch to start adding changes to
   the repository.
